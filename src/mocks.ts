As we\'ve been talking about on Alt.Latino for some time, Mexican Regional music broke through in a big way this year, and we found it incredible to witness the most boisterous and uncompromising sounds from that long tradition make their way across the world and to the top of the charts. \\n\\nA strong feeling of authenticity to place and experience was palpable across the spectrum of Latin albums released in 2023, from the most popular to those deserving of more attention. To review all there was to love about Spanish-language music this year, hosts Felix Contreras and Anamaria Syare sat down with producer Isabella Gomez Sarmiento to discuss the ways musicians danced fearlessly across genre lines while showing up as their complete selves more than ever before.\\n\\nLearn more about sponsor message choices: podcastchoices.com/adchoices\\n\\nNPR Privacy Policy", "shortDescription":"", "trackId":1000639184937, "trackName":"Alt.Latino\'s favorite music of 2023", "releaseDate":"2023-12-20T08:00:00Z", "feedUrl":"https://feeds.npr.org/510305/podcast.xml", "country":"USA", "artworkUrl600":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts126/v4/c1/41/01/c141015f-1872-f04e-83d1-d0138b34c36e/mza_17011789873181933113.jpg/600x600bb.jpg", "kind":"podcast-episode", "wrapperType":"podcastEpisode"}, \n{"artworkUrl60":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts126/v4/c1/41/01/c141015f-1872-f04e-83d1-d0138b34c36e/mza_17011789873181933113.jpg/60x60bb.jpg", "artistViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/npr/125443881?mt=2&uo=4", "artworkUrl160":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts126/v4/c1/41/01/c141015f-1872-f04e-83d1-d0138b34c36e/mza_17011789873181933113.jpg/160x160bb.jpg", "episodeFileExtension":"mp3", "episodeContentType":"audio", "contentAdvisoryRating":"Clean", "trackViewUrl":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/regional-goes-global-part-3-how-a-magical-mexican/id413505303?i=1000638659940&uo=4", "trackTimeMillis":1674000, "collectionViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/alt-latino/id413505303?mt=2&uo=4", "artistIds":[125443881], "closedCaptioning":"none", "collectionId":413505303, "collectionName":"Alt.Latino", \n"previewUrl":"https://chrt.fm/track/138C95/prfx.byspotify.com/e/play.podtrac.com/npr-510305/traffic.megaphone.fm/NPR7254936032.mp3?d=1674&size=53578275&e=1197954438&t=podcast&p=510305", \n"episodeUrl":"https://chrt.fm/track/138C95/prfx.byspotify.com/e/play.podtrac.com/npr-510305/traffic.megaphone.fm/NPR7254936032.mp3?d=1674&size=53578275&e=1197954438&t=podcast&p=510305", "genres":[{"name":"Music", "id":"1310"}], "episodeGuid":"82c8a908-56d4-4d10-8b20-6de64b7c46d2", \n"description":"You know all those tubas and brass instruments you hear behind your favorite regional Mexican hits?

The band\'s struggles with musical and personal identity also reflect the real struggles that millions of U.S.-born folks with Mexican heritage face.

Something in the music industry was changing. Streaming numbers for regional Mexican shot up astronomically, as the musical stylings of banda and norteño made their way onto the Coachella main stage and burgeoning stars like Peso Pluma began to book their first U.S. tours in major markets. But what accounted for regional Mexican\'s rise? And what does the genre\'s continued popularity say about not just changing trends in the Latin music industry, but the changing shape of America? \\n\\nFor the next three episodes of Alt.Latino, Anamaria Sayre and Felix Contreras dive into the regional Mexican explosion, revealing the complex relationships both Mexicans and Mexican Americans have with identity from either side of the border. In this first episode, Felix and Anamaria travel to Nashville, Tenn., to witness Peso Pluma\'s performance and to try to understand the root of the phenomenon, through their own personal experiences and the people they meet along the way.\\n\\nAudio for this episode of Alt.Latino was edited and mixed by Janice Llamoca and Joaquin Cotler, with production support from Shelby Hawkins, Suraya Mohamed, Natalia Fidelholtz and Lauren Migaki.
